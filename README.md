# Education
This 'Education' Github repository contains most of my academic projects, which vary in difficulty and complexity due to the type of tasks and requirements.

## Course Categorization
Each folder corresponds to a specific course of my academic career. You will find my progression through the course in the weekly folder and assignment progression/completion in the Assignments folder. The same logic applies to labs (if applicable to the course).

## Legal
If you have any questions, concerns or I have violated any policies regarding the material posted on this 'Education' repository, send me an email at rrpost@lakeheadu.ca, and we'll discuss this matter further in person if needed
