# Education
This 'Education' Github repository contains most of my academic projects, which vary in difficulty and complexity due to the type of tasks and requirements.

Each folder corresponds to a specific course of my academic career. You will find my progression through the course in the weekly folder and assignments in the Assignments folder. The same logic applies to labs (if applicable to the course).

If you have any questions or concerns regarding the material posted on this 'Education' repository, send me an email at rrpost@lakeheadu.ca, and we'll discuss this matter further in person if needed
