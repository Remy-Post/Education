                    Jolly Ranchers are a popular American brand of sweet, primarily fruit-flavored, candies. They are best known for their original hard candy form: individually wrapped, translucent pieces that offer a long-lasting, intense flavor experience. These hard candies come in a core set of flavors including cherry, blue raspberry, green apple, grape, and watermelon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the hard candies, Jolly Rancher has expanded its product line to include gummies, chews, jelly beans, and even soda. The gummies offer the same bold fruit flavors but in a soft, chewy texture. Special editions and flavor variations, such as tropical or sour versions, are also frequently released.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The brand, now owned by The Hershey Company, is recognized for its vibrant colors, strong fruit flavors, and the signature slightly tart, tangy finish that characterizes many of its offerings. Jolly Ranchers maintain a strong presence across various confectionary types, making them a staple in the candy aisle.

                <p>Jolly Rancher gummies offer the same bold, fruity flavors as the classic hard candies, but in a soft, chewy form. They come in original flavors like cherry, green apple, watermelon, grape, and blue raspberry. Variations include sour and tropical versions. These gummies provide a longer-lasting, less intense flavor experience compared to their hard candy counterparts, and are a popular choice for those who prefer a chewier texture. The gummies are often brightly colored and shaped like little fruits</p>

These individually wrapped, translucent candies come in a variety of options, including the original flavors: cherry, blue raspberry, grape, green apple, and watermelon.

            <p>The large, or "bulk," packs of Jolly Rancher hard candies offer the same intensely flavored, individually wrapped candies as smaller packs, but in a significantly greater quantity. These larger bags, often containing hundreds of pieces, are ideal for sharing, parties, or keeping a readily available supply. While the flavors remain consistent with the classic lineup (cherry, blue raspberry, green apple, grape, watermelon), the bulk packaging emphasizes value and quantity over individual portion control. The focus is purely on the volume of sweets</p>
