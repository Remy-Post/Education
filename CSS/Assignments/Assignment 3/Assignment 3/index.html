                Jolly Ranchers are a popular American brand of sweet, primarily fruit-flavored, candies. They are best known for their original hard candy form: individually wrapped, translucent pieces that offer a long-lasting, intense flavor experience. These hard candies come in a core set of flavors including cherry, blue raspberry, green apple, grape, and watermelon.
                Beyond the hard candies, Jolly Rancher has expanded its product line to include gummies, chews, jelly beans, and even soda. The gummies offer the same bold fruit flavors but in a soft, chewy texture. Special editions and flavor variations, such as tropical or sour versions, are also frequently released.

            <p>Jolly Rancher gummies offer the same bold, fruity flavors as the classic hard candies, but in a soft, chewy form. They come in original flavors like cherry, green apple, watermelon, grape, and blue raspberry. Variations include sour and tropical versions</p>
            <p>These gummies provide a longer-lasting, less intense flavor experience compared to their hard candy counterparts, and are a popular choice for those who prefer a chewier texture. The gummies are often brightly colored and shaped like little fruits</p>

            <h3><strong>LARGE</strong> BAG</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The large, or "bulk," packs of Jolly Rancher hard candies offer the same intensely flavored, individually wrapped candies as smaller packs, but in a significantly greater quantity</p>
                <p>While the flavors remain consistent with the classic lineup (cherry, blue raspberry, green apple, grape, watermelon), the bulk packaging emphasizes value and quantity over individual portion control. The focus is purely on the volume of sweets</p>

            <p>Tropical Jolly Ranchers transport your taste buds to a warmer climate, departing from the traditional fruit flavors. These candies, available in both hard candy and gummy forms, feature vibrant combinations like Fruit Punch (a mixed-fruit medley, often with cherry/berry notes), Golden Pineapple (sweet and tangy), and Mango (sweet, slightly tart, and fragrant). Lime could appear in the tropical set. These flavors often come in mixed bags or as limited-edition releases.</p>
